SoundSpaces is a realistic acoustic simulation platform for audio-visual embodied AI research. From audio-visual navigation and audio-visual exploration to echolocation, this platform expands embodied vision research to a broader scope of topics.

Presentation videos can be found at our [project page](http://vision.cs.utexas.edu/projects/audio_visual_navigation/).

## Motivation
Moving around in the world is naturally a multisensory experience, but today's embodied agents are deaf---restricted to solely their visual perception of the environment. We introduce audio-visual navigation for complex, acoustically and visually realistic 3D environments. We further build *SoundSpaces*: a first-of-its-kind dataset of audio renderings based on geometrical acoustic simulations for two sets of publicly available 3D environments (Matterport3D and Replica), and we instrument [Habitat](https://github.com/facebookresearch/habitat-api/blob/master/README.md) to support the new sensor, making it possible to insert arbitrary sound sources in an array of real-world scanned environments.

## Citing SoundSpaces
If you use the Habitat platform in your research, please cite the following [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.11474.pdf):

```

## Installation 
1. Install [habitat-api](https://github.com/facebookresearch/habitat-api) and [habitat-sim](https://github.com/facebookresearch/habitat-sim)
2. Install this repo into pip
```
pip install -e .
```
3. Following instructions on the [dataset](soundspaces/README.md) page to download the rendered audio data and datasets

## Usage
This repo supports benchmarking PointGoal, AudioGoal and AudioPointGoal with different sensors on two datasets. Below we show the commands for training and evaluating AudioGoal with Depth sensor on Replica, but it applies to the other two tasks, other sensors and Matterport dataset as well. 
1. Training
```
python av_nav/run.py --exp-config av_nav/config/replica/train_telephone/audiogoal_depth.yaml --model-dir data/models/replica/audiogoal_depth
```
2. Validation (evaluate each checkpoint and generate a validation curve)
```
python av_nav/run.py --run-type eval --exp-config av_nav/config/replica/val_telephone/audiogoal_depth.yaml --model-dir data/models/replica/audiogoal_depth
```
3. Test the best validation checkpoint based on validation curve
```
python av_nav/run.py --run-type eval --exp-config av_nav/config/replica/test_telephone/audiogoal_depth.yaml --model-dir data/models/replica/audiogoal_depth EVAL_CKPT_PATH_DIR data/models/replica/audiogoal_depth/data/ckpt.XXX.pth
```
4. Generate demo video with audio
```
python av_nav/run.py --run-type eval --exp-config av_nav/config/replica/test_telephone/audiogoal_depth.yaml --model-dir data/models/replica/audiogoal_depth EVAL_CKPT_PATH_DIR data/models/replica/audiogoal_depth/data/ckpt.220.pth VIDEO_OPTION [\"disk\"] TASK_CONFIG.SIMULATOR.USE_RENDERED_OBSERVATIONS False TASK_CONFIG.TASK.SENSORS [\"POINTGOAL_WITH_GPS_COMPASS_SENSOR\",\"SPECTROGRAM_SENSOR\",\"AUDIOGOAL_SENSOR\"] SENSORS [\"RGB_SENSOR\",\"DEPTH_SENSOR\"] EXTRA_RGB True TASK_CONFIG.SIMULATOR.CONTINUOUS_VIEW_CHANGE True DISPLAY_RESOLUTION 512 TEST_EPISODE_COUNT 1
```
5. Interactive demo
```
python scripts/interactive_demo.py
```
